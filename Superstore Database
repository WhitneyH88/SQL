Superstore Database
In this project, I wrote your SQL code to query a Superstore Database.
This is an example of data you might work with at a company like Costco, Big Lots, Amazon, Walmart, TJ Maxx, Target, CVS, Dollar General, or Home Depot.

CREATE TABLE superstore (
    item_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    item_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INTEGER,
    average_rating DECIMAL(3, 2)
);

INSERT INTO superstore (item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating)
VALUES
    (1, 'Stainless Steel Cookware Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 89.99, 50, 4.6),
    (2, 'Memory Foam Mattress', 'Furnishings', 499.99, 30, 4.8),
    (3, 'Smart LED TV', 'Electronics', 549.00, 20, 4.5),
    (4, 'Robot Vacuum Cleaner', 'Appliances', 199.50, 40, 4.3),
    (5, 'Wireless Bluetooth Speaker', 'Electronics', 39.99, 60, 4.2),
    (6, 'Non-Stick Baking Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 29.95, 80, 4.4),
    (7, 'Cotton Bedding Set', 'Furnishings', 89.00, 25, 4.7),
    (8, 'Smart Home Security Camera', 'Electronics', 79.95, 15, 4.1),
    (9, 'Air Purifier', 'Appliances', 129.50, 35, 4.6),
    (10, 'Premium Coffee Maker', 'Kitchen Supplies', 79.99, 50, 4.9),
    (11, 'Ergonomic Office Chair', 'Furnishings', 189.00, 20, 4.5),
    (12, 'Wireless Earbuds', 'Electronics', 49.99, 75, 4.3),
    (13, 'Slow Cooker', 'Appliances', 49.95, 30, 4.7),
    (14, 'Cutlery Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 34.50, 40, 4.4),
    (15, 'Cozy Throw Blanket', 'Furnishings', 24.99, 100, 4.2);
