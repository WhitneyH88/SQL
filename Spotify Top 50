For this project, I downloaded 2021 Spotify data from Kaggle.
Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- First I determined the top ten most popular tracks of the year, accompanied by the artist who performed them. --
Select artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
Order By popularity Desc
Limit 10

--Second, I determined which songs had a song key greater than 8 and a song mode of 1 in ascending order. --
Select artist_name,track_name, song_key, song_mode
from Spotifydata
Where song_key > 8
AND song_mode = 1
Order By song_key asc

--Third, I determined which song is the worst to do dance to --
Select artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
Order by danceability asc
Limit 1

--Fourth, I had to know which 5 songs are the best to dance to --
Select artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
Order by danceability desc
limit 5
