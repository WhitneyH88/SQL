--For this project we are working with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.--


--1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.-- 
select CustomerId,FirstName,LastName,Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> "USA"

--2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.--
select CustomerId,FirstName,LastName,Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil"

--3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.--
select invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry, customers.FirstName, customers.LastName
FROM invoices
JOIN customers
ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
WHERE BillingCountry = "Brazil"

--4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.--
select * from employees
Where Title LIKE "%Sales%Agent%"

--5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.--
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM invoices 
ORDER BY BillingCountry

--6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.--
SELECT invoices.InvoiceId, employees.FirstName ||" "|| employees.LastName AS AgentName
FROM invoices, employees, customers 
WHERE customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
AND customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId

--7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.--
SELECT invoices.InvoiceId, customers.FirstName ||" "|| customers.LastName AS CustomerName, customers.Country, employees.FirstName ||" "|| employees.LastName AS AgentName, invoices.Total
FROM invoices, customers, employees
WHERE customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
AND customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId

--8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?--
select COUNT (*)
from invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%"

--9.What are the total sales for 2009?--
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%"

--10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.--
SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceLineId,
       tracks.TrackId,
       tracks.Name,
  FROM invoice_items
       JOIN
       tracks ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId;

--11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.--
Select invoice_items.InvoiceId, invoice_items.TrackId, tracks.Name as Song, artists.Name AS Artist
FROM invoice_items
JOIN tracks
ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
Join albums
ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
Join artists
ON albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId

--12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.--
select tracks.Name as Tracks, albums.Title as Albums, media_types.Name as MediaType, genres.Name as Genre
From tracks
JOIN albums
ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
JOIN media_types
ON tracks.MediaTypeId = media_types.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres 
ON tracks.GenreId = genres.GenreId

13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
  SELECT employees.FirstName || " " || employees.LastName as "Sales Agent", SUM(invoices.Total) as "Total Sales" 
  FROM Employees, Customers, Invoices
  Where employees.EmployeeId == customers.SupportRepId 
  AND customers.CustomerId == invoices.CustomerId 
  GROUP By employees.FirstName;

14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
